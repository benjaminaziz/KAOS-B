\ac{RBAC} models are access policies that associate access rights to roles of subjects on objects. The incremental development of software by adding new features and the insertion of new access rules potentially render the model inconsistent and create security flaws. This paper proposes modeling \ac{RBAC} models using the B language such that it is possible to reevaluate the consistency of the models following model changes. It shows the mechanism of formalizing \ac{RBAC} policies of an \ac{EMS} using B specifications and illustrates the verification of the consistency of the \ac{RBAC} specification, using model checking and proof obligations.
