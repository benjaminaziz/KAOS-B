\ac{RBAC} models are access policies that associates access rights to roles of subjects on objects. The incremental development of software by adding new features and the insertion of new access rules potential render the model inconsistent and creates security flaws. This paper proposes modeling \ac{RBAC} models using B language such that it is possible to reevaluate the consistency of the model following changes to the model. It shows the mechanism of formalizing \ac{RBAC} policies of an \ac{EMS} using B specifications and illustrates the verification of the consistency of the \ac{RBAC} specification, using model checking and proof obligations.
