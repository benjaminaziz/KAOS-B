RBAC models are access policies that associates access rights to roles of subjects on objects. The incremental development of software by adding new features and the insertion of new access rules potential render the model inconsistent and creates security flaws. This paper proposes modeling RBAC models using B language such that it is possible to reevaluate the consistency of the model follwoing changes to the model. It shows the mechanism of formalizing RBAC policies of an Electronic Marking System (EMS) using B specifications and illustrates the verification of the consistency of the RBAC specification, using model checking and proof obligations.
