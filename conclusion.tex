RBAC security policy is considered as one of the most effective security models to different critical systems, such as business systems.  Formal specification is now widely used to verify security constraints/properties of RBAC models in different ways and several languages.  This paper discussed the use of the B method to develop a consistent specification for the RBAC security policy of the Electronic Marking System (EMS).   There was the use of two approaches for formal verification: model checking and proof obligations.  Model checking was represented by the application of proB tool, while proof obligations constructed a mathematical statement/proof for the RBAC model to be true.  Both mechanisms proved that our RBAC specification is correct and consistent regarding the implementation of the system operations.
